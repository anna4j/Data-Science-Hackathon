# Project Problem Statement for Hackathon

Your client is an Insurance company and they need your help in building a model to predict  whether the policyholder (customer) will pay next premium on time or not. An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified  premium. A premium is a sum of money that you pay regularly to an insurance company for this  guarantee.   
 
Building a model to predict whether a customer would make the premium payment can be  extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers who are less likely to pay and convince them to continue making timely payment. Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would pay the next premium or not, you have information about past premium payment history for the policyholders along with their  demographics (age, monthly income, area type) and sourcing channel etc.
